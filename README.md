# Simple Statistics

This plugin provides simple statistics for flashcards.
The target is to have a simple overview of the upcoming days and the number of flashcards.

This plugin is in an early stage and will be extended in the future.

I have many ideas, which I will be working on in the future, some ideas are heavily insprired by the plugin requests provided in the [RemNote Community](https://feedback.remnote.com/b/Plugin-Requests).

Beside making a simplified statistics page in the sidebar, I also want to look at [this feature request](https://feedback.remnote.com/p/show-card-rating-history-after-answer) next, as I would like to use this, too.
For now this plugin will not be listed, until I find it useful enough to be listed.
